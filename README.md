# react-terminal

ðŸ–¥ React component that renders a Terminal. Heavily based on the package by [bony2023](https://github.com/bony2023/react-terminal).

## Looking for Sponsors/Contributors
While my time is restricted, I'm still committed to this library. To help focus development, sponsorship is appreciated for urgent feature requests. I strongly encourage community contributions through pull requests. Feel free to submit them for any issues or new features, and I'll be happy to review them. Thank you!

## Features

- Mobile support. ðŸ“±
- Customizable commands, prompt and error message. âœ…
- Support callbacks(async/non-async) for commands. ðŸ”„
- Command history using arrow up and down. ðŸ”¼
- Support for copy/paste. ðŸ“‹
- In-built themes and support to create more. ðŸš€

## Installation

Install package with NPM or YARN and add it to your development dependencies:

```sh
npm install react-terminal
```

## Usage

```js
import { ReactTerminal } from "react-terminal";

function MyComponent(props) {
  const commands = {
    whoami: "jackharper",
    cd: (directory) => `changed path to ${directory}`,
  };

  return <ReactTerminal commands={commands} />;
}
```

Also make sure to wrap the main mountpoint around the `TerminalContextProvider`. This retains the state even when the component is unmounted and then mounted back:

```tsx
import { TerminalContextProvider } from "react-terminal";

ReactDOM.render(
  <TerminalContextProvider>
    <App />
  </TerminalContextProvider>,
  rootElement,
);
```

## Creating custom themes

```tsx
<ReactTerminal
  commands={commands}
  themes={{
    "my-custom-theme": {
      themeBGColor: "#272B36",
      themeToolbarColor: "#DBDBDB",
      themeColor: "#FFFEFC",
      themePromptColor: "#a917a8"
    }
  }}
theme="my-custom-theme"
/>
```
